## Hey, my name is Jason Montas. I am currently a junior studying computer science at SUNY New Paltz. Some of my hobbies include playing drums, playing guitar, watching movies, and playing games like solitaire and minesweeper. I have been very into music my whole life, but recently I’ve been making punk, shoegaze, and electronic music.

## Some of the upper-level computer classes I’ve taken here at New Paltz are software engineering, object-oriented programming, and assembly language. I am currently taking operating systems, language processing, and web page design which I hope will aid me in this class. I have not worked on many big programs and projects yet, but I recently started working on a website for my band with my friends using Vue, so I am already a little familiar with the framework.

## I see myself using this class to further my understanding of how websites are made and allowing me to improve the website I am currently working on as I learn more. I am pretty excited about this class and am ready to put in the necessary work to make something really cool.
